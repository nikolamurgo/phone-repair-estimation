# Mobile Phone Repair Estimation Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for estimating repair durations for mobile phones based on various factors such as phone brand, model, repair problem, and date received. The model helps mobile phone repair services optimize their repair processes and provide accurate repair time estimates to customers.

## Features
- Predict repair durations for mobile phones based on historical repair data.
- Visualize the distribution of repair duration categories by phone brand and repair problem.
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Explore feature importance to understand factors influencing repair durations.
- Provide insights and recommendations for improving repair processes and customer satisfaction.
